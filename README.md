# 👋 Hi, I'm Kamil

Computer Science student at **Gdańsk University of Technology**, focused on building a career as a **Linux System Administrator**. I work primarily in Linux environments and enjoy understanding system internals, automation, and troubleshooting complex configurations.

In my spare time, I sharpen my skills on **Hack The Box**, write automation scripts, and experiment with embedded systems.

## 🧰 Tech Stack & Interests

- 🐧 **Linux Administration** – system configuration, service management, shell environments  
- 🔧 **Automation & Scripting** – Python, Bash, cron jobs, task automation  
- 🔐 **Security & CTFs** – Hack The Box challenges, basic pentesting, service hardening  
- 🤖 **Arduino & Microcontrollers** – GPIO control, sensors, embedded projects  
- 🐳 **Containerization** – Docker, Home Assistant, self-hosted services  
- 🛠️ **Debugging & Troubleshooting** – diagnosing system issues, log analysis

## 🏠 Home Lab

I run a self-hosted environment where I practice system administration and experiment with production-grade tools:

- **n8n** – workflow automation and integration platform  
- **Samba** – file sharing and network storage services  
- **Nginx** – reverse proxy and web server configuration  
- **Zabbix** – infrastructure monitoring and alerting  
- **Grafana** – metrics visualization and dashboard creation  

This setup allows me to gain hands-on experience with real-world services and DevOps practices.
