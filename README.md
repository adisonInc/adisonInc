# 👋 Hey, I'm Kamil

I'm studying Computer Science at Gdańsk University of Technology. I feel most comfortable in Linux environments and like to dive into how things work under the hood. In my free time, I automate tasks, write scripts, and break down challenges on Hack The Box.

## 🧰 What I'm into

- 🐧 **Linux** – my main OS; configs, services, terminal life  
- 💻 **Programming** – mostly Python, Bash, and some C/C++  
- 🔐 **Security** – Hack The Box, basic pentesting, service analysis  
- 🔌 **Embedded & electronics** – microcontrollers, GPIO, sensors  
- 🧠 **Debugging & reverse** – I like solving weird system issues
